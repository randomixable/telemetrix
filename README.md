# telemetrix
Technical R&amp;D framework for kinematic telemetry analysis. Features Python ETL pipelines for data normalization and JavaScript heuristics for vehicle state detection. Derives physical metrics (G-Force, Lean Angle, Gradient) from raw GPS fixes. Stress-tested in the high-altitude mountain terrains of Kopeng and Selo.
